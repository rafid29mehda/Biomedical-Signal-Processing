## **Detrending (Removing Linear Trend): Complete Documentation and Beginner-Friendly Explanation**

### **What is Detrending?**

**Detrending** is the process of removing a **linear trend** from a signal. A linear trend is a slow, straight-line increase or decrease over time that can distort signal analysis—especially in frequency or statistical calculations.

Imagine you are measuring a signal, but over time, the instrument drifts slowly upward or downward. Detrending helps to **isolate the true fluctuations** in the signal by removing that underlying trend.

### **Why Detrend a Signal?**

* To remove slow drifts or slopes that aren’t part of the actual signal.
* To make statistical or spectral (frequency) analysis more accurate.
* To focus only on the fluctuations or oscillations around the mean.

### **What is a Linear Trend?**

A **linear trend** is a straight line (positive or negative slope) that gradually increases or decreases. In many real-world systems, signals include this type of unwanted background trend.

## **Example Code Walkthrough: Linear Detrending in MATLAB**

### **Step 1: Create a Synthetic Signal with a Linear Trend**

```matlab
n = 2000;
signal = cumsum(randn(1,n)) + linspace(-30,30,n);
```

* **`n = 2000;`**: We create a signal with 2000 data points.
* **`randn(1,n)`**: Generates 2000 random values from a standard normal distribution (mean=0, std=1).
* **`cumsum(...)`**: Computes the cumulative sum of the random numbers, simulating a signal with slow, random fluctuations.
* **`+ linspace(-30,30,n);`**: Adds a straight-line trend from -30 to 30 across all 2000 points. This simulates a **linear drift**.

So now, the signal contains two things:

1. Random noise fluctuations
2. A slow, linear drift upward

### **Step 2: Remove the Linear Trend (Detrending)**

```matlab
detsignal = detrend(signal);
```

* **`detrend(signal)`**: MATLAB’s built-in function that removes the best-fitting straight line from the signal.
* The result is a **detrended signal**, where the long-term slope has been subtracted out.
* This allows you to analyze the true signal more cleanly.

### **Step 3: Plot the Original and Detrended Signal**

```matlab
figure(1), clf
plot(1:n, signal, 1:n, detsignal,'linew',3)
legend({ ['Original (mean=' num2str(mean(signal)) ')' ]; [ 'Detrended (mean=' num2str(mean(detsignal)) ')' ]})
```

* Opens a figure window and clears it.
* Plots both the original signal and the detrended signal.
* Adds a legend showing the mean value of each:

  * The original signal will have a large mean (due to the trend).
  * The detrended signal should have a mean close to 0.

This visualization clearly shows how the trend has been removed.

| Step          | Purpose                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Create Signal | Simulate real-world data with a linear trend       |
| Detrend       | Remove the underlying drift to reveal fluctuations |
| Plot          | Visually confirm that the trend was removed        |

## **When Should You Use Detrending?**

* When analyzing frequency content (e.g., FFT) and trends distort your results.
* When comparing different parts of a signal and the baseline shifts.
* In **neuroscience**, **climate science**, **finance**, and any time series analysis.

Detrending is a foundational preprocessing step that helps clean your signal, making it easier to analyze meaningful changes without being fooled by background drift.
